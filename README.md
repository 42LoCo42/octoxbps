You'll need "git" and "qt5" packages in order to get latest dev version!

To download and build the source code, type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aarnt/octoxbps
$ cd octoxbps/sudo
$ qmake-qt5
$ make
# make install
$ cd ../notifier
$ qmake-qt5
$ make
# make install
$ cd ..
$ qmake-qt5
$ make
# make install
```

To run it:

$ octoxbps

You'll need "curl" and "sudo" installed and your user to be a member of the wheel group.

Enjoy!
