This is OctoXBPS, a powerful XBPS front-end using Qt libs. 
================================================================

You'll need "git" and "qt5" packages in order to get latest dev version!

To download the source code, type:

	$ git clone https://github.com/aarnt/octoxbps
	$ cd octoxbps
	$ qmake-qt5
	$ make

To run it:

	$ bin/octoxbps

You'll also need a privilege escalation tool to use it. 
OctoXBPS supports "kdesu" and "gksu" for that.

Enjoy!
